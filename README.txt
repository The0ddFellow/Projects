In this repo, I will upload all the project I work on. In the development
directory, theres random code that I made to learn stuff, currently just to
learn git bash and vim. In microcontroller_stuff directory, theres a bunch of
arduino code. Don't have git on my raspberry pi yet but soon. The project
euler directory has a bunch of projects from a website, mainly to learn
languages.
